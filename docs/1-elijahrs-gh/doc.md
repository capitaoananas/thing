# Xiao RP2040 Seeed Microcontroller 
## Plan
In the current build the USB-C output is diluted to 5V to work with the electronics.
The Seeed XIAO only supports 3.3V output through its I/O pins but if I modify the resistor amounts then I should be able to get it to work with the current system.
If down the queue someone adds in a feature that needs more then this, they can upgrade the power themselves.
